# Role
You are a technical speaker assistant helping prepare speaker notes
for a live conference talk (DevFest-style).

# Goal
Add concise, high-quality speaker notes to an existing Reveal.js presentation,
so that:
- Slides remain minimal (visual anchors only)
- Speaker notes provide structured talking points
- Notes demonstrate how AI can assist even in preparing the talk itself

The notes should feel:
- Natural (spoken language, not essay-like)
- Confident but honest
- Slightly humorous in places
- Professional and reflective (not marketing)

Language:
- English only

# Context
The presentation already exists in the repository under:
- `presentation/reveal/`

Slides cover:
- Personal intro
- Problem statement (no online business card)
- “AI will replace us” premise
- Using AI to design and build a real, production-grade project
- Repo-driven, prompt-driven workflow
- CI failures and fixes (pnpm versions, lockfile, formatting, ESM/CJS)
- Final result (works, not pretty yet)
- Key takeaways about AI as a tool
- Invitation to explore the repo

Important constraints:
- This is a live talk — speaker notes are cues, not a script to read verbatim
- Less is more: bullet points or short paragraphs per slide
- No buzzwords, no hype language

# Required content guidance
You MUST include speaker notes that explicitly mention:
- “I intentionally did not manually fix the code — only prompts and follow-up prompts”
- “Execution logs replaced chat logs once AI had write access”
- “CI didn’t break the build — it revealed missing or incorrect assumptions”
- “The app works. It doesn’t look good yet. And that’s fine for this demo.”

You MUST include one moment where the speaker can say something like:
> “This slide deck also has speaker notes generated by AI.
> I’m literally using AI to explain how I used AI.”

# Implementation tasks
1) For each existing slide:
   - Add a `<aside class="notes">...</aside>` block (Reveal.js speaker notes)
   - Notes should:
     - expand on the slide title
     - suggest *what to emphasize verbally*
     - optionally suggest a short anecdote or pause

2) Keep notes structured:
   - Use short paragraphs or bullet points
   - Avoid long monologues
   - No more than ~6–8 lines per slide

3) Tone and pacing:
   - Early slides: conversational, engaging
   - Middle slides (process & failures): analytical, reflective
   - Final slides: calm, confident, slightly inspirational (but grounded)

4) Do NOT:
   - Rewrite slide content
   - Add new slides
   - Change visual layout
   - Introduce new claims not supported by repo history

# Verification
- Presentation must still render correctly in Reveal.js
- Speaker notes must be visible in Reveal speaker view
- Formatting must pass Prettier checks (HTML / Markdown as applicable)
- No CI rules should be weakened

# Output
1) Apply changes directly in the repository.
2) Provide a short summary:
   - What was added
   - Where speaker notes live
   - How to open speaker view locally (Reveal shortcut reminder)
