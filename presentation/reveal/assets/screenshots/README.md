# Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots of the working application in its current (unpolished) visual state.

## Required files

Save the following screenshots here:

1. **me-page.png** — Personal page (Łukasz Piotr Łuczak bio, roles, links)
2. **company-page.png** — Luczak Consulting page (service areas, registry info)
3. **contact-page.png** — Contact form page (form with validation)

These images are referenced in the presentation slides to demonstrate that the application is functional, even if not yet visually polished.

## Usage in slides

The screenshots appear in slides 12-14 (after "What Works Today") with captions:
- "It works."
- "Still functional."
- "This is fine."

They support the narrative: AI successfully scaffolded production infrastructure, visual polish comes later.
