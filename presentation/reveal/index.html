              Hi, I'm Łukasz Piotr Łuczak — easier to show you my online business card than spell it… I never had time to build one… AI will replace us… let's test AI on this task.

            # The Problem

            - No online business card
            - Manual networking is inefficient
            - Scattered social profiles

            <aside class="notes">
              As a consultant and speaker, I needed a single-link digital business card. But like many developers, I kept postponing this simple project.
            </aside>

            ---

            # The Premise

            **"AI will replace us"**

            Let's test this claim:
            - Can AI build a production-ready platform?
            - From scratch to deployment?
            - No manual coding?

            <aside class="notes">
              We hear this all the time: AI will replace developers. Instead of debating, I decided to test it. Can AI build my business card platform from zero to production?
            </aside>

            ---

            # The Project

            **Digital Business Card Platform**

            - Single-link contact hub
            - Bilingual (EN/PL)
            - Mobile-first, SEO-optimized
            - Tabs: Me, Consulting, Contact, Events, Publications
            - Production-grade standards

            <aside class="notes">
              Not a toy project. A real platform with i18n, structured data, accessibility, security headers, and deployment.
            </aside>

            ---

            # The AI-Assisted Process

            **Artifacts Pipeline:**

            1. Information Architecture
            2. Brand & Visual Identity
            3. Design Profile (design-profile.json)
            4. Tailwind Theme CSS
            5. HTML Prototypes
            6. Repository DX Setup
            7. Architecture (NestJS + Astro)
            8. Implementation

            <aside class="notes">
              This wasn't "write me a website." It was a structured workflow: discovery, branding, design system, prototypes, architecture, then code.
            </aside>

            ---

            # Key Constraint

            **No manual fixes — only prompts**

            - Every change via AI prompt
            - Follow-up prompts for refinement
            - Execution logs replaced chat logs
            - Quality gates made issues visible

            <aside class="notes">
              The rule: I could only give prompts. If something broke, I had to prompt a fix. This forced me to test AI's real-world capability.
            </aside>

            ---

            # Friction Point 1

            **pnpm Version Conflict**

            - CI specified `version: 9`
            - package.json specified `pnpm@9.15.0`
            - pnpm/action-setup@v4 detected conflict

            **Solution:**
            Remove CI version, use package.json as single source of truth

            <aside class="notes">
              First CI failure: conflicting pnpm versions. AI fixed it by removing redundancy. Lesson: tooling assumptions matter.
            </aside>

            ---

            # Friction Point 2

            **Missing pnpm Lockfile**

            - CI ran pnpm install
            - No pnpm-lock.yaml committed
            - Non-deterministic builds

            **Solution:**
            Generate and commit pnpm-lock.yaml

            <aside class="notes">
              Second failure: no lockfile means unpredictable builds. AI added it. Reproducibility requires explicit state.
            </aside>

            ---

            # Friction Point 3

            **Prettier Format Check Failures**

            - AI-generated code wasn't formatted
            - CI format check failed

            **Solution:**
            Run pnpm run format:fix before commit

            <aside class="notes">
              Third failure: AI wrote valid code, but didn't match Prettier style. Quality gates caught it immediately.
            </aside>

            ---

            # Friction Point 4

            **ESM/CommonJS Module Mismatch**

            - NestJS built as ESM
            - Astro SSR adapter expected CommonJS
            - Runtime crash: "Cannot use import outside module"

            **Solution:**
            Add build:postprocess to write package.json with type: commonjs

            <aside class="notes">
              Fourth failure: module system mismatch. AI debugged it, but required multiple prompts. Complex runtime issues are hard for AI.
            </aside>

            # What Works Today

            - ✅ Bilingual SPA (EN/PL)
            - ✅ Tabs with icon + label
            - ✅ Light/Dark mode
            - ✅ SEO metadata + JSON-LD
            - ✅ Security headers (CSP, HSTS)
            - ✅ Contact form API (stub)
            - ✅ CI/CD quality gates
            - ✅ Coolify-ready deployment

            <aside class="notes">
              What AI delivered: a real, production-grade platform. Not perfect, but functional and secure.
            </aside>

            ---

            # What's Intentionally Unfinished

            - ⏳ Contact form email integration (stub only)
            - ⏳ CAPTCHA (planned, GDPR-friendly)
            - ⏳ CSP hardening (remove unsafe-inline)
            - ⏳ Analytics (privacy-first, post-MVP)

            <aside class="notes">
              Some features are stubbed on purpose. The goal was to test AI's ability to scaffold, not to over-engineer.
            </aside>

            # Key Lessons

            **AI accelerates, but needs guidance**

            - AI is a powerful tool, not a replacement
            - Quality gates are essential
            - Humans steer strategy and architecture
            - Works best for structured, well-scoped tasks
            - Struggles with runtime debugging and edge cases

            <aside class="notes">
              Bottom line: AI didn't replace me. It accelerated me. I still made every architectural decision. AI executed, I directed.
            </aside>

            ---

            # The Honest Takeaway

            **Can AI replace frontend developers?**

            - ❌ Not for complex, production systems
            - ✅ For simple, well-defined tasks
            - ✅ As an accelerator with human oversight
            - ✅ When paired with quality gates

            **Developers who use AI > Developers who don't**

            <aside class="notes">
              AI didn't replace me, but it made me faster. The real question isn't "Will AI replace us?" It's "Will developers who use AI replace those who don't?"
